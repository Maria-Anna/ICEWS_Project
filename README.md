Forecasting Armed Intrastate Conflict with help of ICEWS Data

According to the Uppsala Conflict Data Program, armed intrastate conflicts and civil wars were directly responsible for more than 50,000 deaths solely in 2020. 
To possibly intervene and save lifes, predicting such organized violence before it occurs is thus of tremendous interest to researchers and policymakers alike.
While most applications focus on the prediction of fighting incidence within a binary regression context, recent research widens the focus to also predicting 
the intensity of such violence instead of only forecasting its occurrence. In this context, theory-driven variable selection, statistical learning perspectives,
but also machine learning approaches can be beneficial for increasing our ability to predict fighting and thus be of societal use. Based on these advances and 
new data on rebel military capabilities, forecasting models for the prediction of the incidence and intensity of fighting in armed intrastate conflict are developed.
Fighting is observed in geographical 50kmx50km grid-cells and at daily instances with historical data going back to 1991; hence the available data poses complex and
challenging problems with around 19 million observations and 500 features. Given this unit of observation, fighting is a very rare event, often occurring in short
bursts, whose instances are linked both spatially and temporally. Forecasting models have to appropriately account for these points.
